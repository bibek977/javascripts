// We can use \ to write string when we use '' or "" multiple times

let dialogue = "I can't resist myself by saying \"Let's start\" "

// let dialogue = "I can't resist myself by saying "Let's start" "   This is complex so ..

console.log(dialogue)

console.log(dialogue.indexOf("st"))

console.log(dialogue.lastIndexOf("st"))

console.log(dialogue.lastIndexOf("st",40))
// search "st" from 40
